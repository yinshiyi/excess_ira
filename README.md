# 5329 instruction excerpt
You received a distribution subject to the tax on early distributions from a qualified retirement plan (other than a Roth IRA). However, if distribution code 1 is correctly shown in box 7 of all your Forms 1099-R and you owe the additional tax on the full amount shown on each Form 1099-R, you don’t have to file Form 5329. Instead, see the instructions for Schedule 2 (Form 1040), line 8, in the Instructions for Form 1040, or the Instructions for Form 1040-NR, for how to report the 10% additional tax directly on that line.
# 8606 instruction excerpt
You include $1,073 on your 2021 Form 1040, line 4a, and $73 on line 4b. You attach a statement to your tax return explaining the distribution. Because you properly removed the excess contribution with the related earnings by the due date of your tax return, you aren’t subject to the additional 6% tax on excess contributions, reported on Form 5329. However, because you were under age 59½ at the time of the distribution, the $73 of earnings is subject to the additional 10% tax on early distributions. You include $7.30 on Schedule 2 (Form 1040), line 8.
# instruction from 590-B
Withdrawals of contributions by due date. If you withdraw contributions (including any net earnings on the contributions) by the due date of your return for the year in which you made the contribution, the contributions are treated as if you never made them. If you have an extension of time to file your return, you can withdraw the contributions and earnings by the extended due date. The withdrawal of contributions is tax free, but you must include the earnings on the contributions in income for the **year in which you made the contributions**.
